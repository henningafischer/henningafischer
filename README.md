## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I'm Henning. 👋

I’m not a classic software engineer. I’m a builder who uses code to make sense of the world. 

### Why I code
I love code because I love the logic behind it. For me, it’s the ultimate tool to make complexity visible. Whether it’s a messy business process or a huge dataset, I enjoy building the "pipes" and dashboards that turn chaos into something you can actually work with.

### How I work
- Vibe Coding & AI: I use AI (Cursor, LLMs) as a high-speed exoskeleton. It allows me to prototype complex ideas in hours, not weeks. 
- Logic over Syntax: I care more about the system architecture and the "why" than about memorizing every library. 
- The Goal: Building stable "vessels" where creativity and innovation can happen without the usual operational friction.

### 🔭 Current Focus & Experiments
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Digital Twin – making him do all the fun things I would do (most of the time at least :D)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to further bridge the gap between AI-generated logic and production-grade stability.
- 💬 Ask me about code application in media development or how to visualize system friction.
- 😄 Pronouns: he

### 🛠 Tools I'm currently playing with
- Python / NiceGUI: For building fast, internal tools that look decent.
- OSINT & Research Agents: Automating the boring stuff to get to the deep insights faster.
- Social Network Analysis: Using math to visualize how people and systems actually interact.

### 🚀 Recent "Vibe-Coding" Projects
- Pegasus: An AI-driven research engine that does the heavy lifting for outreach.
- NexusConnect: A pipeline to bridge the gap between job data and personalized communication.
- Gazelle: Deep diving into behavioral patterns using audio and linguistic data.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I met three different kings in my life so far, but it didn't impact my life at all :D

Always down for a chat about system thinking, AI workflows, or how to fix broken processes with a bit of logic.
